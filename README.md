# Approach 1
Implementation can be found in `approx_count_st_approach_1.py`

# Approach 2
Implementation can be found in `approx_count_st_approach_2.py`
This is just the base implementation. For the full implementation with convergence heuristics, see the C repository.

# Approach 3
Implementation can be found in `approx_count_st_mtt.py`

# Example
An example usage of the approximate count algorithm can be found in `main.py`. It uses Approach 3.
