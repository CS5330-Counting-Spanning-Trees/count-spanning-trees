# this file contains functions to store graphs that we have generated
# main functions are save_data and load_data
# Usage of fix_keys: If you load a dict with integer keys from json, call d = fix_keys(d) to
# convert the keys back to ints

import json, os

def save_data(data, path):
    with open(path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f)

def load_data(path):
    with open(path, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    return data

# json will save dict keys as strings, even though they are ints
# so when loading a dict from json, need to convert the keys back to ints
# returns the fixed dictionary
